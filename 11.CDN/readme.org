#+TITLE: 11. Content Delivery Network

* Requirements
1. Ngrok `brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok`
* Balancing approaches
Run siege in the same network from docker

#+begin_src shell
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f siege
#+end_src
#+RESULTS:

** Cache ON
1. Add nginx config with cache to the docker services
2. Test results

** Cache OFF. Least connected
1. Add to the global + us nginx properties
#+begin_src conf
  upstream ... {
      least_conn;
      ...
  }
#+end_src

** Cache OFF. Session fixation
1. Add to the global + us nginx properties
   #+begin_src conf
    upstream ... {

    }
