* Summary
- System has performance gaps between 25 and 30 concurrent users
  According to the logs the root cause is in DataDog agent


* Probabistic cache model
1. Configure Playframework + MongoDB according to the [[https://medium.com/geekculture/rest-api-with-scala-play-framework-and-reactive-mongo-5016e57846a9][steps]]
2. mkdir ~/data
3. Run Scala project by
   #+begin_src bash
sbt run
   #+end_src
4. Run Siege by
   #+begin_src bash

siege -c50 -t60S --content-type "application/json" 'http://localhost:9000/movies GET'
   #+end_src
