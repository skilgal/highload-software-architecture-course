* Common IDEA
Create client via GAMP (Google Analytic Measurement Protocol)

* Current implementation
We choose the python as the main language
Python has PyGAMP lib to send GA data
* Execution
./send-currency.sh will generate event each 120s (2 minutes) to send analytic as separate client to the predefined GA_TRACKING_ID

The result and sent events could be seen on the Event page
